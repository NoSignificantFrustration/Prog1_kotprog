# About

A mandatory object oriented Java project for my programming I. course.
Class stubs were provided with unimplemented methods, and requirements of what said methods should do. Once implemented, it all added up to a rudimentary game.
An automated testing system was provided for feedback and grading.

It reads images as input to construct maps, then simulates the game.

There is no user interface to speak of, everything happens internally.
